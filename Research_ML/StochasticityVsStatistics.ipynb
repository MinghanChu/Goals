    "# A fundamental distinction between stochastic flow realizations, statistical similarity, and deterministic constraints in conditional generation\n",
    "\n",
    "## DNS\n",
    "\n",
    "DNS Runs (Multiple Simulations with Same Conditions):\n",
    "- If you run DNS multiple times with the **same initial and boundary conditions**, the flow fields should be **almost identical** at each time step due to the **deterministic nature** of the **Navier-Stokes equations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unconditional Generation vs. DNS\n",
    "- Unconditional Generation: When generating flow fields **without any sensor constraints**, the realizations may **differ from specific instantaneous DNS flow fields**, but they can **still match DNS statistics** (e.g., mean, variance, spectra).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stochastic vs. Statistical Similarity\n",
    "looking at randomness in generated flow fields, we have different levels of stochasticity and constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Fully Random (No Statistical Similarity)\n",
    "- If you randomly generate flow fields without conditioning on DNS data, they could have any arbitrary structure and may not match DNS statistics.\n",
    "- This would be like generating random noise—it does not resemble DNS in any meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Stochastic but Retains Statistical Similarity (Unconditional Generation)\n",
    "- The generated flow fields do not match any specific DNS **snapshot** at a given time step, but **their statistical properties** (mean, variance, correlation lengths, energy spectra) match DNS distributions.\n",
    "- This is what happens in unconditional generation using diffusion models.\n",
    "- Each realization is different from an instantaneous DNS field but still looks “DNS-like” on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Constrained Stochasticity (Conditional Generation with Sensors)\n",
    "- Here, the generated flow fields match both the statistics and certain instantaneous flow features due to sensor constraints.\n",
    "- The stochasticity is now restricted by the measurement inputs, meaning the generated flow fields:\n",
    "1. Retain the correct statistical properties (mean, variance, spectra) like in unconditional generation.\n",
    "2. Conform to specific observed features (sensor measurements, ensuring the flow is more DNS-like at particular locations).\n",
    "3. Still have some randomness in the unmeasured regions but are physically plausible due to the learned generative model.\n",
    "- This is like a **stochastic reconstruction problem**, where the model predicts missing details while ensuring global consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional generation\n",
    "The regions outside sensor locations start with a **high level of stochasticity**, but as conditional inference progresses, the **influence of sensor-constrained information propagates**, gradually steering the generated flow fields **toward DNS-like behavior**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial Stochasticity in Unobserved Regions\n",
    "- At the start, the regions without sensor data **retain the randomness** dictated by the generative model.\n",
    "- Since the model has been trained to capture DNS statistics, these unobserved regions already look physically plausible but remain stochastic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Gradual Influence of Sensor Constraints\n",
    "- Through conditioning, the sensor-constrained regions act as “anchors,” forcing the generated fields to be consistent with real DNS data.\n",
    "- Due to spatial correlations in turbulence, information from sensors propagates through the domain via the **generative model’s learned structures**.\n",
    "- This **gradually forces randomness** in the unobserved regions, aligning them more with DNS.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How Stochasticity Evolves\n",
    "- Near Sensors: The flow quickly conforms to DNS because the direct observations constrain the generative process.\n",
    "- Far from Sensors: Initially, the flow retains more randomness, but with each inference step (especially in diffusion-based models), the constraints push the field closer to DNS.\n",
    "- Large-Scale vs. Small-Scale Structures: **Large coherent structures are influenced faster, while smaller turbulent details take longer to align due to their chaotic nature.**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Analogy: Diffusing Information Like a PDE\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like solving an inverse problem:\n",
    "- The generative model starts from an unconstrained state.\n",
    "- Sensor constraints act as boundary conditions.\n",
    "- As inference progresses, the unobserved regions are “corrected” over time, similar to how diffusion propagates corrections in a PDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Final Outcome\n",
    "- In highly constrained cases, the entire field closely matches DNS.\n",
    "- In weakly constrained cases, some stochasticity persists in unobserved regions, but statistical consistency with DNS remains.\n"
