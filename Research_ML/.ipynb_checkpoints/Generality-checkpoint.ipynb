    "# Generality\n",
    "\n",
    "Generality for a trained Machine Learning model can be categorized into different levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Levels of Generality in Machine Learning Models for CFD\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\underline{\\textbf{Basic Generality (Traditional Definition)}}$\n",
    "Definition: A trained model is considered to have a high degree of generality if it can accurately predict different flow cases, such as varying Reynolds number (Re), angle of attack (AoA), and geometries, without requiring retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common in: Surrogate models, physics-informed NNs, and some ML-based turbulence models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limitations: Requires the training dataset to cover a wide range of flow conditions to generalize effectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\underline{\\textbf{Generality in a Diffusion Model (Junior Level)}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: A trained diffusion model can generate corresponding flow realizations under different conditioning inputs (e.g., RANS, sparse sensor data, low-resolution LES) without retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Key Strength:\n",
    "- Zero-shot conditioned generation: The model, trained unconditionally, can take in different types of constraints (e.g., RANS, sparse data) and generate the correct corresponding realizations without needing new training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Limitation:\n",
    "- Flow cases must remain within the distribution of the training data.\n",
    "- If a case is far outside the training set (e.g., different Re, AoA, or flow regime), the model may fail to generate accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: If trained on LES of a single airfoil shape at AoA = 5°, the model can reconstruct corresponding LES-quality flow given RANS inputs but may not generalize well to a different airfoil or AoA = 30°.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\underline{\\textbf{High-Level Generality in a Diffusion Model (Senior Level)}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: A trained diffusion model not only produces flow realizations under different conditioning inputs but also generalizes to entirely different flow regimes (e.g., laminar-to-turbulent transitions, wakes, new geometries, high Re, different angles of attack) without retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A vast and diverse training dataset, covering multiple flow regimes, geometries, Re, and AoA values (as you mentioned, Jianxun Wang suggests 10^3 subsequences for large-scale generalization).\n",
    "- A more advanced architecture, possibly incorporating latent space regularization, physics constraints, and multi-scale representations to ensure generality across vastly different flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very challenging: Difficult to achieve in practice because the model needs to learn a broad probabilistic distribution that encompasses many different flow regimes. It requires huge computational resources for training to cover high-dimensional, multi-regime turbulence physics."
